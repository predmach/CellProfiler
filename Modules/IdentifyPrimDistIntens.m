% Help for the Identify Primary Distance Intensity module: 
%
% This image analysis module identifies objects by finding peaks in the
% distance transform of a thresholded image.  Once a marker for each object
% has been identified in this way, a watershed function identifies the
% lines between objects that are touching each other by looking for the
% dimmest points between them.  To identify the edges of non-clumped
% objects, a simple threshold is applied. The algorithm works best for
% objects that are round-shaped, where the dividing lines between clumped
% objects are dim.  The objects need not be brighter towards the interior as is
% required for the intensity-based algorithm.

%%% Adds a random value between 0 and 0.05 to each pixel in the DistanceTransformedImage
